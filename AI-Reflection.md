# AI Reflection

## How I use AI in learning and development

I use AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** mainly to speed up my work and learning process.  
When I forget something or need a quick reminder, I can simply ask instead of searching manually.  
I also use AI to generate simple pieces of code — for example, creating basic tables, forms, or other repetitive UI parts where normally you just spend a lot of time writing basic structures.

For more complex features, I prefer to write the code myself.  
In those cases, I might use AI for theoretical help or best practice suggestions, but I don’t trust AI to fully write complicated logic.  
It’s crucial to **always carefully check** AI-generated code because mistakes or bad practices can happen, and it’s important to fully understand and control your codebase.

## Tools I've tried

- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot

## What helps and what hinders

ChatGPT and Copilot help me save time on basic tasks and getting unstuck quickly.  
But I also know that relying too much on AI without understanding the code is risky, so I always try to validate the output and think critically.

## How I would integrate AI into frontend workflow

I would use AI to:

- Generate repetitive or basic code faster
- Help with brainstorming UI ideas
- Assist with documentation writing
- Provide theoretical support when needed

At the same time, I would always manually check, test, and improve any code generated by AI to make sure everything stays high-quality and maintainable.
